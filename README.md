# onimeshWinGUI

This is the GUI for OniMesh(OM), which will be used mainly as a launcher for OM itself. It has ben developed using QT Creator 3.5.0 (opensource), with C++, based on QT 5.5.0. It's the latest version of QT since I installed it (September 27th, 2015).

For information on QT, go to http://www.qt.io/ide/
To download QT, access http://www.qt.io/download/ and state that you're developing Open source software in order to get the free opensource version. 

Simply install it.

Open QT and open the project in this repository.

When prompted to configure the project, check the box that says "Desktop QT 5.5.1 MinGW 32bit" and click "Configure Project".

Once you've opened this project using QT, simply build it and run it. The GUI will appear.
